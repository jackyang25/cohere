  Cohere.Examples.ObstetricsDemo

  This module is for learning and prototyping only.
  It is NOT clinical advice and is NOT part of the trusted kernel.

  Intention:
  - define a small concrete `Fact`/`Action` universe
  - instantiate a tiny ruleset
  - sanity-check `Derive` and `Accept` against the paper examples

  Note: we intentionally do NOT import this module from `Cohere.lean`.
